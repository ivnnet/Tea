        <h2>History of the Tea Time Alarm</h2>
        <p>The tradition of tea time dates back centuries in the UK, with its origins in the early 1800s. The Tea Time Alarm was introduced as a way to preserve the tradition and ensure that every citizen has the opportunity to enjoy their tea breaks on time. It became a legal requirement in 1924 and has been enforced ever since to ensure national harmony and health.</p>

            <p>In the 1920s, a national Tea Time policy was implemented to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their class or status, had a moment to relax and refresh. The alarm became a mandatory part of the day in the UK, contributing to the nation's health and well-being. The ritual remains intact today, representing both tradition and law.</p>
